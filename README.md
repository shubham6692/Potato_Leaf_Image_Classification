# Whatâ€™s the difference between early blight and late blight?
## Different Causes
Early blight is caused by two different closely related fungi, Alternaria tomatophila, and Alternaria solani, which lives in soil and plant debris.
Late blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans, a microorganism which prefer moist and cool environments.
## Different Symptoms
Early blight mainly affects the stems, leaves, and fruits of vegetables, and is most susceptible to disease at the branches of leaves and stems. At the seedling stage, the base of the stem of the seedlings is dark brown lesions, slightly sunken, and has a ring pattern. The onset of adulthood generally develops from the lower leaves to the upper part. The leaves are infected, the primary brown necrotic small points, and then expanded into a round to nearly round, dark brown, with concentric wheel pattern, the wheel surface has a thorny hair, and some varieties have a yellow-green halo around the lesion.
